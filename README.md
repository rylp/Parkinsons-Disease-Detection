# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection

## Overview

Worked on a Medical Computer Vision project involving Parkinson's Disease Detection by using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Machine Learning and OpenCV on the images generated by the Spiral-Wave test.
Detected non-uniform patterns and distortions in handwriting through the Spiral-Wave tests and classified images as Parkinson's or Healthy.
Used **Random Forest Classifier** for Spiral images in the dataset and **KNN** for Wave images along with **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** for quantifying the images before training. Achieved **86.66%** accuracy for **Spiral** and **76.66%** accuracy for **Wave** images in the dataset  

## Preprocessing & Training
The following preprocessing was applied to each image:

- Have trained the network on frontal handwritten images
- Resized every image to 200 Ã— 200 pixels from the input images of random sizes
- Converted each image from RGB to GrayScale to have a single channel using `cv2.cvtColor`
- Thresholding the image so that it appears as white on a black background for better feature extraction using `cv2.threshold`
- After this , HOG was used to extract features from the images by using `feature.hog` function
- For *Spiral* : `RandomForestClassifier` was used for fitting & For *Wave* : `KNeighborsClassifier` was used.
